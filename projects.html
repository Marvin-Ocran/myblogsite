                    <h2>2024</h2>
                    I actually worked in the corporate world in 2024.
                    I interned at Kasapreko Plc at the management account 
                    department. Got to work on costing, variance reporting and
                    stock taking and a lot of interesting accounting problems were solved.

                </h2>
                Started work on clariasfreshfish.com, a platform that 
                allowed local fish farmers to sell their produce, 
                directly to the final consumer without dealing selling 
                to middlemen at cheap prices or dealing with the 
                logistics. Lots of reasons why it didn't work out. 
                The site was built but couldn't figure out the demand side, or the supply side or the logistics of transporting fresh fish. 
                Turns out logistics in Ghana is really hard, who knew.

                Started to work on an integrated LMS that helped 
                streamline the online education process. Planned 
                features included an ai teaching assistant, book recommendations
                from various scholars and a daily 
                cache of informative videos. 
                Failed because of co founder disputes.

                Worked on an startup that intended to 
                help transition taxis in ghana from 
                fossil fuel cabs to electric. Secure 
                taxi drivers who were committed to 
                receiving the vehicles on a work and 
                pay basis, but failed because we couldn't
                find an ev manufacturer/distributor to 
                partner.
