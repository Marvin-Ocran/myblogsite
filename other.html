            <h2>BOOKS</h2>
            <p><h3>1984 ( FICTION, SCI-FI )</h3>
                I'm still in the process of reading it, about halfway through.
                It uncanny how the real world is slowly starting to mirror Goerge Orwell's fictional one
                with the gradual progression of mass censorship, and survailllance. Good read so far.

                <h3>The Magicians ( FICTION, FANTASY )</h3>
                A high fantasy book by Lev Grossman. One of my favourite books ever. The combination of everyday university life
                with high fantasy other world elements is really well done. I rarely read books multple times but I'm certain I'll read this again some time in the future.

                <h3>The Unicorporated Man ( FICTION, SCI-FI )</h3>
                Great book by Dani and Eytan Kollin. The premise of selling shares of yourself is fascinating. It 
                might eventually happen considering how high household debts are rising. Good read
            </p>

                <h3>Wheel of time ( FICTION, FANTASY )</h3>
                Great set of book by Robert Jordan. Really good series, but soooooo many books. I've read six of them I think. More to go
            </p>

                <h3>The House of the Scorpion ( FICTION, SCI-FI ) </h3>
                Read it multiple times. Great book. It raises lot's of ethical questions one cloning 
                and gene editing. Will we get to the point of not just growing organs in the lab but people too?
            </p>
