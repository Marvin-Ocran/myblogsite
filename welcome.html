                    <h2>WHAT'S THE PURPOSE</h2>
                To share lessons, track my progress and comment on things.
                Basically things too long to post.

                    <h2>WHY IS EVERYTHING GRAY</h2>
                Cus it's easier to read white text on a gray background.
                There are no images on this site. I want to keep it as basic 
                as possible so no images, no fancy animations.
                Just HTML and CSS.

                    <h2>WHAT TO EXPECT</h2>
                Stuff on computers, finance, books, both 
                fiction and non fiction, research work and projects. 
                Plus random things I find interesting
